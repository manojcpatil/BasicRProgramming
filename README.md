# Unit I: Introduction to R and Basic Data Objects

**Introduction to R:** R is a powerful programming language and environment designed specifically for statistical computing and data analysis. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, statistical modeling, visualization, and more.

**Syntax of R Expressions:** The syntax of R expressions includes fundamental concepts such as:

* Vectors: A basic data structure in R that can hold elements of the same type.
* Assignment: Using `<-` or `=` to assign values to variables.
* Logical Vectors: Vectors containing logical (Boolean) values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
* Character Vectors: Vectors containing text strings.

**Data Objects:** R supports various data objects essential for data handling and analysis:

* Basic Data Objects: Scalars, vectors, matrices, arrays, and lists.
* Matrices: Two-dimensional data structures with rows and columns.
* Arrays: Multi-dimensional data structures.
* Lists: Ordered collections of objects (can contain heterogeneous types of data).
* Factors: Categorical data objects with predefined levels.

**Functions:** R includes a rich library of built-in and user-defined functions:

* Elementary Functions: Basic mathematical and statistical functions.
* Applying Functions to Subsets: Applying functions to specific subsets of data using vectorized operations.

**Data Frames:** Data frames are a fundamental data structure in R used for organizing and manipulating structured data:

* Creating Data Frames: Constructing data frames from vectors or other data structures.
* Combining Data Frames: Merging or appending data frames.
* Adding Variables: Adding new columns (variables) to existing data frames.

This introductory unit lays the foundation for understanding the basic concepts and functionalities of R, preparing learners to work with data efficiently and effectively within the R environment.
